# Writing Plugins

Try and keep your plugins as cross-framework compatible as possible. Here are some suggestions to make installing and using your plugin as simple as possible, no matter what framework someone is using.

1. Make using it easier for everyone and put the plugin file at the root level of your plugin repository instead of in a subdirectory. This allows [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) users install it with a simple `git clone git@github.com:you/yourplugin.git` in the `custom/plugins` directory and also let [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) and [zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen) users automatically clone the repository without having to specify a subdirectory path.

2. Only oh-my-zsh sets the `${ZSH_CUSTOM}` variable. `$(dirname $0)` will also tell you what directory your plugin is installed in and has the advantage of both being cross-framework and not breaking when a user inevitably renames your plugin directory.

3. Don't assume your plugin will be checked out into a directory with the same name you gave the plugin. This is another case where `$(dirname ${0})` will work and `${ZSH_CUSTOM}/hardcoded-directory` will fail.

4. Use `yourplugin.plugin.zsh` for the main plugin file. This is what [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) expects. [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen), [zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen) and most other ZSH frameworks will automatically load that filename.

5. If youâ€™re making a theme, please include a screenshot so prospective users can see what it looks like before they install it.

6. Submit a PR here so your plugin is easy to find :-)
