# Contributing

First and foremost, thanks for the help, I appreciate all of the contributions, and the awesome-zsh-plugins list wouldn't be nearly as complete without them.

## To add to the list:

Submit a pull request.

* Descriptions should be clear, concise, and non-promotional
* Descriptions should follow the link, on the same line
* Each entry should be a single line. This makes keeping the sections sorted easier. We let the GitHub formatter handle adding any required line breaks.
* Each item should be limited to one link, and that link should be the first part of the line.
* If you're submitting a theme, please try to make sure that the theme repo has a screen shot so that list users can tell what it looks like before installing it.
* Please make sure all framework, plugin, themes or completions list entries are sorted *alphabetically*.
* The link should be the name of the package or project

## To remove an entry:

Open an issue to discuss why the entry should be removed, and optionally create a PR.
